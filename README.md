# dotfiles
These are my dotfiles for the various programs that I use. Feel free to download them and use them yourself, most of them are modified versions of other people's dotfiles. 
- In .zshrc there are aliases for brew commands, you can find them at the end of the file. 
	- bget=brew install 
	- bunget=brew uninstall
	- bupgrade=brew upgrade
	- blist=brew list
- The chunkwmrc & skhdrc files are close to default and as such, the default shortcuts should work fine.
	- I changed the border and padding of windows and stuff in chunkwmrc.
