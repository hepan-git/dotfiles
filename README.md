# dotfiles
These are my dotfiles for the various programs that I use. Feel free to download them and use them yourself, most of them are modified versions of other people's dotfiles. Since I use a Mac there is no guarantee that these will work on Linux, I also don't think that chunkwm is available on Linux.
- The chunkwmrc & skhdrc files are close to default and as such, the default shortcuts should work fine.
	- I changed the border and padding of windows and stuff in chunkwmrc.
