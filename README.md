# dotfiles
These are my dotfiles for the various programs that I use. Feel free to download them and use them yourself, most of them are modified versions of other people's dotfiles. 
- In .zshrc there are aliases for brew commands, you can find them at the end of the file. (get=brew install, unget=brew uninstall)
